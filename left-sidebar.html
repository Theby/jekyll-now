									<h2>Mass Effect: The Charon Relay</h2>
									<p>Fan-made non-profitable tabletop RPG adaptation</p>

								<span class="image featured"><img src="http://pre15.deviantart.net/b24e/th/pre/i/2015/331/5/9/mass_effect_rpg_1_by_martingust-d9i660v.jpg" height:"600" width:"800" /></span>
								
								<p>Made only for the fans of both tabletop RPG and Mass Effect games, this adaptation is based
								on the Fantasy AGE system by <a href="http://greenronin.com/">Green Ronin </a>and is used for 
								Dragon Age, Fantasy AGE, Blue Rose and Titansgrave games.</p>
								
								<h3>What's the game about?</h3>
								<p>The original Fantasy AGE is meant for a less-tactical faster-peaced gameplay in Combat, Exploration and Interpretation encounters,
								and is set in a little-to-none technology ambientation (except Titansgrave, but it's still scarce in the world).</p>
								
								<p>This adaptation has completely different classes, talents, specializations and magics/arcana (now called Powers). The gameplay or rather how
								the game flows is also different, giving a feeling of a more cover-to-cover shooting tactical game (much like XCOM).</p>
								
								<p>Also there are Shield points besides the Health Points for characters and Powers only recharge, they don't consume anything equivalent to Mana or Magic Points.
								This is to make the game mechanics reflect more of the Mass Effect world.</p>
								
								<p>There are also Weight mechanics and non-combat related talent points besides regular talent points. These are meant to guide
								the player towards a more balanced and role-specific character, yet it does not limit the player's choices on how to build his character.</p>
								
								<p>All these changes and new mechanics and changes do require some more ruling than the original Fantasy AGE, but to keep the 
								original spirit of a fast-paced and easy-to-learn game, most of these new rules are common bonuses or only apply when improving your character.</p>

								Suspendisse laoreet metus ut metus imperdiet interdum aliquam justo tincidunt. Mauris dolor urna, 
								fringilla vel malesuada ac, dignissim eu mi. Praesent mollis massa ac nulla pretium pretium. 
								Maecenas tortor mauris, consectetur pellentesque dapibus eget, tincidunt vitae arcu. 
								Vestibulum purus augue, tincidunt sit amet iaculis id, porta eu purus.</p>
